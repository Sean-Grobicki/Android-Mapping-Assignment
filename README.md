# Android-Mapping-Assignment

Due to this assignment running on a web server which does not run anymore do the app does not fully function. The purpose of this app was to map the nearest train stations to the location of the phone. We used a web server which had a list of all the train stations and returned the data in XML format so it was necessary to parse it. There are some screenshots of the working app in the Screenshots folder and also there is the specification in the Information folder. This program was developed in one day and you can view the code for this in the folder.
